            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Our frequency analyses of each game's horizontal mouse movement
              indicate that FPS and TPS games (where the player must constantly
              move their mouse around to change their camera view and aim in
              specific spots) have more frequent wrist movements than a game
              like League of Legends, where the camera is relatively fixed in a
              birds-eye view and needs less aiming in particular parts of the
              screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              We discovered a research paper by Christina Bach Lund et. al
              analyzing similar wrist movements in different occupations and
              their relations to development of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In this
              paper, the mean power frequencies of wrist movements during the
              work day were calculated and a clear connection was found between
              higher-frequency wrist movements and an increased risk to
              developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a more slow-paced game like League of Legends, the average
              wrist movement frequency was found to be &lt; 0.2 Hz; in the
              paper, this frequency corresponded to jobs such as office workers
              and bank assistants. Given that there aren't many constant, fast
              mouse movements in League of Legends, this relationship makes
              sense. On the other hand, fast-paced games where the player has to
              rapidly move their mouse (to either switch camera views or aim)
              had higher frequencies in the range of 0.3 - 0.45 Hz.
              Wrist-intensive jobs, such as laundry and slaughterhouse workers,
              had similar high wrist frequencies.
            </p>
            <h4>What does this tell us?</h4>
            <p>
              In games from the FPS and TPS genre, where constant and rapid
              mouse movements are required, players are essentially moving their
              wrist as frequently as people in intensive jobs would. Meanwhile,
              games with less aiming and less need to switch camera views have
              fewer wrist movements. Therefore, in TPS and FPS games, players
              should be more mindful of how often they're playing and make sure
              to take breaks in between so they don't damage their wrists.

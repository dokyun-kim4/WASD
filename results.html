            <h3>Wrist Pain Scale</h3>
            <img src="images/wrist_pain_rating.png" />
            <p>
              The MATLAB code snippet above shows how we simplified the maximum
              frequencies we obtained from each game to a scale from 1 to 5 on
              wrist pain-- 1 being on the lower end of possible wrist pain (with
              frequencies between 0.2 to 0.25) and 5 being the higher end, with
              wrist movement frequencies above 0.4 Hz.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this scale, the games below would score wrist pain numbers of:
              <li><b>League of Legends:</b> 1</li>
              <li><b>Frostpunk:</b> 1</li>
              <li><b>Counter Strike 2:</b> 3</li>
              <li><b>Titanfall 2:</b> 3</li>
              <li><b>Risk of Rain 2:</b> 4</li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Our frequency analyses of each game's horizontal mouse movement
              indicate that FPS and TPS games (where the player must constantly
              move their mouse around to change their camera view and aim in
              specific spots) have more frequent wrist movements than a game
              like League of Legends, where the camera is relatively fixed in a
              birds-eye view and needs less aiming in particular parts of the
              screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              We discovered a research paper by Christina Bach Lund et. al
              analyzing similar wrist movements in different occupations and
              their relations to development of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In this
              paper, the mean power frequencies of wrist movements during the
              work day were calculated and a clear connection was found between
              higher-frequency wrist movements and an increased risk to
              developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a more slow-paced game like League of Legends, the average
              wrist movement frequency was found to be &lt; 0.2 Hz; in the
              paper, this frequency corresponded to jobs such as office workers
              and bank assistants. Given that there aren't many constant, fast
              mouse movements in League of Legends, this relationship makes
              sense. On the other hand, fast-paced games where the player has to
              rapidly move their mouse (to either switch camera views or aim)
              had higher frequencies in the range of 0.3 - 0.45 Hz.
              Wrist-intensive jobs, such as laundry and slaughterhouse workers,
              had similar high wrist frequencies.
            </p>
            <h4>What does this tell us?</h4>
            <p>
              In games from the FPS and TPS genre, where constant and rapid
              mouse movements are required, players are essentially moving their
              wrist as frequently as people in intensive jobs would. Meanwhile,
              games with less aiming and less need to switch camera views have
              fewer wrist movements. Therefore, in TPS and FPS games, players
              should be more mindful of how often they're playing and make sure
              to take breaks in between so they don't damage their wrists.
            </p>
            <h3>Recommendations and Application</h3>

            <p>
              Many of the methods and exercises of companies for office worker
              ergonomics can be applied to gaming. Both spend prolonged periods
              in an office setting with continuous and sometimes rapid wrist
              movement. Some of those methods include posture, proper angle of
              your wrist, periodically changing positions, and stretching.
            </p>
            <p>
              While these exercises are often preached as good practice, many do
              not follow them. That is where our data can become useful. Two
              categories determine when an injury can occur. Rapid and prolonged
              movement are both the worst-case scenarios. Using the existing
              data, we can create metrics and recommendations based on the type
              of activity. Or, if we want to integrate a smart and active
              system, we could have data be viewed live. Similar to a fitness
              watch telling you to get up and move, we can have a device
              actively monitor wrist frequency to determine when breaks or
              exercise are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, what do we do if said movement needs to be done during a
              long-duration game? One can't simply stop playing when the action
              is at its climax. A simple game monitoring software like Overwolf
              can be paired to our device's programming to avoid the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two genres of games that generated the highest frequency were
              FPS and TPS games; thus, following recommended ergonomic practices
              or using your forearm more instead of only your wrist is vital.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are some wrist exercises we heavily recommend you do in
              between or after games:
              <li>
                <b>Prayer Position Stretch:</b> Place your palms together in
                front of you and slowly move your hands towards your stomach
                until you feel your wrists stretch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Palm-to-Floor/Palm-to-Ceiling Stretch:</b> With one palm
                facing towards the floor, gently use the other hand to bend your
                fingers back towards you until you feel a stretch in your wrist.
                You can do the same with your palm facing the ceiling.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Wrist Circles:</b> With palms facing the floor, make a loose
                gripping gesture around invisible bike handlebars. Move your
                wrists up/down and side to side, and follow with rotating your
                wrists in circles towards the inside and then outside of your
                body.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Hand Open-and-Close:</b> Make a tight fist and hold it close
                for several seconds. Then open your hand and spread your
                fingers, holding the pose for several seconds.
              </li>
            </p>
